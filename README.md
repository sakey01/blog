# Personal Blog Page

## 💡About
This is a blog application built with react, typescript and firebase. 

You can view other's posts or if you feel like it, give them a like.

Creating posts is more complicated, you need to sign up with an email address and password. 

Once done, you can write as many posts as you want.

Note: This was my first time working with firebase and typescript. The design was also made with the help of AI.

## 🧠 What I learned
I got to see how firebase worked under the hood. How to create collections, connect the create post interface to the database and how to authenticate users. I learnt how to build a robust sign up page and keep users's data secure and that if you leak your firebase API key you'll be fine. And a bunch more...
